                <p style="padding-top: 2em;">Hi everyone! My name is Karle and I'm one of the stat 100 instructors. I've always loved math, statistics, and education. Teaching stat 100 is the perfect job for me since I can help students from many different majors gain an appreciation for all 3.<br /><br /> A few other things about me: I'm a huge Illini fan- I went to school at UIUC, met my husband at UIUC, and now I work here. U of I is one of my favorite places in the world! I also enjoy spending time outside, playing piano, water skiing, snow skiing, and traveling.</p>

In addition to being a Stat 100 CA, I am also a research assistant for an audiology lab here on campus.

Some other facts about me: I am in the Marching Illini Drumline and play the cymbals, so hopefully you can catch me on game days when they hopefully happen again.
